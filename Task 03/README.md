## Iris Flower Classification

This project was based on training a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of Iris flowers and accurately classify those into their respective species.
I tested various machine learning models for prediction in jupyter notebook and chose the best model with higher accuracy.
While fitting the model I used pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. libraries.
