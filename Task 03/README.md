## Iris Flower Classification

This project is based on training a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of Iris flowers and accurately classify those into their respective species.
I tested various machine learning models for prediction in jupyter notebook and chose the best model with higher accuracy.

**Tools Used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. libraries.
