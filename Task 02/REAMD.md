## Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This project is based on building a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
I used linear regression for prediction in jupyter notebook.
While fitting the model I used pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. libraries
